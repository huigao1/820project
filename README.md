Housing violations in NYC threaten tenant safety and urban livability. The HPD issues violations for unsafe conditions, but identifying high-risk buildings and optimizing enforcement is challenging due to dataâ€™s volume and complexity. Tenants also face information asymmetry in assessing housing risks.Using geospatial analysis, clustering, and text analysis, this study provides insights to strengthen enforcement, inform policies, and empower tenants. 

Specifically, this project aims to: 
(1) Identify common violation types and trends across boroughs to reduce information asymmetry. 
(2) Cluster buildings by violation severity and recurrence to predict high-risk properties for preventive regulation. 
(3) Examine the relationship between housing types and specific issues to help developers avoid recurring problems. 
(4) Analyze NOV descriptions to uncover recurring themes and patterns for more effective regulatory responses.
